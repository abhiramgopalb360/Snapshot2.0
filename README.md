<li>Define the Baseline ( Optional : Add/remove variables, set bins for numerical variables )

Best Practices
---
<li>If appended Data, it is common to filter it to 'Household' & 'Individual' level match
<li>Apply Regional/state filter as per the client's customer data.
<li>Sample size(3rd party Random Sample) should be same as category size
<li>Use the Epsilon_attributes_binning.xlsx to set your own Bins, Categories & Title for the Category Report
<li>Use EpsilonDataDictionary.xlsx to update definitions.
<li>Currently tested & working for 1 baseline + 2 categories ( max ); if more than 2 need to run the report twice.
